My name is Manuel, I am a computer scientist. Over the years, I have acquired the skills to assemble hardware components and construct a comprehensive system, install and administrate operating systems such as Linux, process incoming data to generate valuable information, and write software that accomplishes useful tasks. I really enjoy my profession.
