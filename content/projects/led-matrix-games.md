Embarking on the journey to build a video game from the ground up has always been one of my ambitions. Understanding the inner workings of a video game and implementing classics have been on my to-do list since my university days.

Utilizing a 64x64 LED matrix, a USB controller, and a Raspberry Pi, I programmed my first Pong and Space Invaders. Upon submitting my project to a contest on [Make Projects](https://makeprojects.com/project/led-space-invaders), I was fortunate enough to win a fantastic [pi-top](https://www.pi-top.com/). If you're curious about the code, you can find it on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/mmartinortiz/rgb-led-matrix-space-invaders), as always.
