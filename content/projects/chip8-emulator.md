During the last months I've been developing a [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator in Python. My main goal was to learn how an emulator works and how to program one. That's why I tried to write as good and comprehensive code as possible. At this point, tagged as [`v1.0.0`](https://github.com/mmartinortiz/chip8emulator/releases/tag/v1.0.0), I consider the emulator complete, as a piece of code that fully emulates a CHIP-8, which does not mean that I will not continue developing some new features now and then. 

Here you can find the source code of my [Chip-8 Emulator](https://github.com/mmartinortiz/chip8emulator) as well as links to the main resources I've used.
