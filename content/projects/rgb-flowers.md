A beautiful and decorative pot with flowers created with my children. My contribution was some soldering and electronics for powering RGB LEDs that cycle across colors. The components used are a couple of RGB LEDs with their corresponding resistors and a Raspberry Pi Pico (my favorite microcontroller). The source code for the RGB cycle can be found on [this repository](https://github.com/mmartinortiz/electronics/tree/main/rgb_led). The project has been strongly inspired by a similar project from Adafruit.
