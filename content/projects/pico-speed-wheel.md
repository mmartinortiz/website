In the late '90s, I purchased a Genius DB15 Wheel controller for playing driving video games. Regrettably, it turned out to be a poor choice as the potentiometers used in constructing the wheel and gear produced significant noise. Moreover, the Windows driver available at that time couldn't effectively handle the noise, resulting in a subpar driving game experience.

The controller ended up stored away in a box until 2020 when it resurfaced during a cleaning day. I opted to give it a fresh start by replacing the DB15 port with a Raspberry Pi Pico and writing my own software to eliminate the noise.

For a more detailed explanation and access to the code, check out my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmartinortiz/pico-speed-wheel) and [Make Projects](https://makeprojects.com/project/reuse-your-old-db15-gamepad-thanks-to-a-raspberry-pi-pico).
