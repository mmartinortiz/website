As part of my university studies, I undertook two projects centered around robots.

For my Computer Science degree, I worked on a project featuring a remote-controlled robot equipped with four infrared LEDs. Additionally, I developed a fully autonomous robot with the primary objective of locating and following the first robot. The progress and details of the project development are documented in [its dedicated blog](https://nine-years.blogspot.com). You can also find videos, including one showcasing the end result, on [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mmartinortiz).

For my Master's in Advanced Artificial Intelligence, I created a communication framework designed for robots operating in environments with unreliable communication. This framework enables autonomous agents to update their understanding of the tasks at hand as well as their knowledge of the surrounding environment.

Check out the video below for an implementation featuring virtual agents using the communication framework.

Throughout the project, I also designed a virtual laser specifically tailored for real robots.

Some scientific articles were authored during the development of the project:

- [Study of a Multi-Robot Collaborative Task through Reinforcement Learning](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21344-1_20)
- [Selective Method Based on Auctions for Map Inspection by Robotic Team](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-21344-1_19)

The project was implemented using the ePuck robot, and I developed a software both in [C++](https://github.com/mmartinortiz/ePuckcpp) and [Python](https://github.com/mmartinortiz/pyePuck).
