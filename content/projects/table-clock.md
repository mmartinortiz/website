Using an ESP32, a potentiometer, a temperature and humidity sensor, and a sleek 7-segment display, I crafted a functional and stylish addition to any workspace.

Nestled discreetly within the IKEA frame, this clock is not just about telling time. With a twist of the potentiometer, switch between displaying the time, current temperature, and humidity on the 7-segment display. The ESP32 acts as the silent orchestrator, ensuring seamless operation and connectivity, and using your Wifi to keep the time in sync with a NTP server.

Extensive instructions for building the clock within the frame can be found in my [Make Project](https://makeprojects.com/project/table-clock) profile.
