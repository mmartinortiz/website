Recently I got a 3D printer and I have been experimenting with it. After a few prints for "very important things", like a [drill guide](https://www.printables.com/model/644028-drill-guide-and-dust-catcher), a [wine bottle holder](https://www.printables.com/model/97000-wine-bottle-holder-for-my-new-kitchen) or a [Lego Extension Card](https://www.printables.com/make/2644977) for my Framework laptop, I thought that it was time to design something myself.

Since my pegboard had still enough room for tools but I run long time ago out of hooks, I took the original hooks and "copied" them in TinkerCAD. A couple of failed prints taught me the importance of measuring properly and count with the printing tolerances.

I'm very happy with the results, and now my pegboard is completely filled with tools. You can download the STL files at my [Printables page](https://www.printables.com/model/1311933-hooks-for-the-parkerside-lidl-powerfix-pegboard)
