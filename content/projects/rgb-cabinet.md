What to do after creating a [Space Invaders game for an RGB LED Matrix]({{< relref "projects/led-matrix-games.md" >}})? Obviously, build a cabinet for RGB games. Using an online service called [Boxes.py's Console2](https://www.festi.info/boxes.py/Console2?language=en) for designing the cabinet and the [PiTop-4](https://pi-top.com) to run the software, I iterated over the previous code and adapted it to the actuators provided by the PiTop: a potentiometer and a button.

Code and build instructions are available in the [project's GitHub repository](https://github.com/mmartinortiz/rgb-led-games).
